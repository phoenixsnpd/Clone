What I expect from the course.
To systematize existing knowledge and get new ones. I want to be able to find a job as a Java developer after I finish the course.

My individual project that I would like to implement
I want to create a project that uses database operations and tools to create web applications. For example: a workflow management application for a restaurant.
The tools I'd like to use:

- Spring Boot.
- MySQL.
- Hibernate/Spring Data JPA.
- etc.
